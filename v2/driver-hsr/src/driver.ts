/**
 * HsrDriver — the first real substrate driver (WP3 of the reset).
 *
 * Implements the RuntimeDriver interface EXACTLY as fixed by WP2
 * (v2/harness/src/driver.ts): the WP2 SimDaemon drives this driver unmodified.
 * Spec: docs/design/specs/reset-03-hsr-driver.md.
 *
 * Behavior mapping to the spec:
 *  1. Parenthood — `start` spawns a detached runner host in its OWN process
 *     group; that host owns the agent child and its pipes. The driver captures
 *     host pid + start-time AT SPAWN (`procOf`), so core can record and exactly
 *     re-adopt the durable runtime across daemon restarts.
 *  2. Truth = structured events — the driver consumes the child's stdout as an
 *     NDJSON line stream; no screen scraping. Every raw line is appended
 *     VERBATIM to the bee's session log (Q1: the log is the native stream;
 *     adapters re-derive observations); the harness adapter distills lines
 *     into DriverObservations and condition-flag evidence.
 *  3. Deliver — writes the adapter-encoded message to the child's stdin at its
 *     accept point. Deterministic: accepted, or refused with `no_process` /
 *     `not_ready` (Q2: a booting runtime refuses; the daemon's delivery loop
 *     retries — no hidden driver-side queue). Delivery doubt cannot exist.
 *  4. Stop — signals the exact spawned process: TERM to its process group,
 *     escalate to KILL after a bounded wait. A dead-already process is
 *     `hadProcess:false`, never an error.
 *  5. Exact identity everywhere — signal targets are only ever the pid the
 *     driver itself spawned and still holds the live ChildProcess handle for
 *     (parenthood: the pid cannot be recycled before the exit event fires,
 *     because the unreaped child holds it). pid + start-time are the durable
 *     identity handed to core for cross-restart re-adoption. No name, alias
 *     or pane is ever a signal target (the CO.a8d2 lesson).
 *  6. observe() never blocks — events drain from an internal buffer fed by
 *     the runner's output-only, generation-scoped journal and host-exit facts.
 *     The core checkpoints parsed journal bytes only after their effects, so
 *     undrained evidence survives daemon death without transcript guessing.
 *
 * WP4 addition — cross-restart re-adoption (contract §3.2): when the daemon
 * PROCESS restarts, ChildProcess handles are gone but the detached host and
 * agent survive. `adopt(...)` verifies exact pid/start-time, reconnects the
 * host socket, and resumes the exact generation journal at core's committed
 * cursor. Missing/corrupt proof falls back to a conservative degraded exact-
 * pid adoption; silence never manufactures idle.
