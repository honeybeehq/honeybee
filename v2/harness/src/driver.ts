/**
 * RuntimeDriver — the substrate driver interface.
 *
 * >>> THIS FILE IS THE DRAFT OF WP3'S REAL DRIVER INTERFACE. <<<
 *
 * Per spec 02 non-goals: "WP3 plugs its real driver into this harness later —
 * the SimDriver interface IS the draft of WP3's driver interface." Everything
 * the SimDaemon needs from a substrate is expressed here and nowhere else; the
 * daemon logic in daemon.ts is written against this interface only, so a real
 * tmux/hsr/cell driver can replace SimDriver without touching the daemon.
 *
 * Model (contract §4.1): the driver owns *processes*; the store owns *state*.
 * The driver never writes the store. It reports facts as observations, which
 * the daemon folds into the store's four-state model. Observations are the
 * normalization layer the contract calls "the most important machinery in the
 * system": heterogeneous harness events become exactly
 * booted / turn_started / turn_ended / exited.
 *
 * Crash semantics (contract §3.2): the daemon is the runtime's parent —
 * process death is a fact reported to it, never a hypothesis. In the sim this
 * means `observe()` retains undrained events across a daemon restart (the real
 * driver re-derives them from session files / child-exit records at boot);
 * a machine reboot kills every process and discards pending events, and boot
 * reconciliation takes over from `snapshotLive()`.
