/**
 * Harness adapters — the normalization layer (WP3, spec 03).
 *
 * One adapter per agent CLI. Pure translation: raw native event-stream lines
 * in, normalized signals out. No state, no I/O, no timers. The contract calls
 * this "the most important machinery in the system" (§4.1): heterogeneous
 * harness events become exactly booted / turn_started / turn_ended (exited is
 * a process fact the driver observes itself), plus condition-flag *evidence*.
 *
 * Q1 resolution (operator): the session log is the verbatim native jsonl
 * stream only. Adapters ARE the normalization — observations are always
 * re-derivable by replaying the log through `parseLine`.
 *
 * Flag evidence (spec 03, resolving WP2 ambiguity 6): adapters only *report*
 * evidence; the daemon acts on it. Every flag-setter has a contrary-evidence
 * clearer in the same adapter:
 *   - `booted` clears `spawn_failed` (the runtime demonstrably came up),
 *   - a successful (non-error) turn end clears `auth_needed` — the turn was
 *     authenticated — and `resource_blocked` — the provider served it,
 *   - a provider "allowed again" rate-limit update clears `resource_blocked`.
 * No flag is permanent short of operator action.
