/**
 * The runner contract behind every login method. A runner owns exactly one
 * method's execution for one flow revision: it moves the flow through its
 * waiting phases, consumes typed input, watches for the credential landing,
 * and can always be stopped. It never reads or writes the flow row directly
 * — every transition goes through the host, which keeps the service the
 * only writer and lets it drop a superseded runner's late events.
 *
 * Three implementations (one per `LoginMethodRun` shape):
 *  - `ClaudeOauthRunner`  direct PKCE + pasted code       (login/claudeOauth.ts)
 *  - `DirectKeyRunner`    Codex / OpenCode API keys       (login/directKey.ts)
 *  - `CliRunner`          the vendor CLI in a native worker (login/cliRunner.ts)
