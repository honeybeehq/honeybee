/**
 * DaemonCore — the daemon's loop cores (WP4 of the reset), extracted from the
 * WP2 SimDaemon so one implementation serves both worlds:
 *
 *  - the invariant harness (`v2:harness`, `v2:harness:real`) drives this exact
 *    code under a virtual clock / fault injector via the SimDaemon wrapper
 *    (v2/harness/src/daemon.ts), so every WP2 invariant keeps proving the
 *    production loops;
 *  - the real daemon (daemon.ts) drives it over wall time with the HsrDriver.
 *
 * Responsibilities per step (spec 04 "Daemon behavior" 1, 3, 4, 5):
 *  1. drain driver observations into the store's four-state model
 *  2. flag policy: apply adapter condition-flag evidence (contrary-evidence
 *     clearing per spec 03 — every setter has a clearer); and record the
 *     harness session id a runtime reported (spec 07 §F: revive resumes it)
 *  3. boot-hang policy: stop runtimes that never produce the bounded boot
 *     readiness handshake. Running turns are unbounded: silence and elapsed
 *     time are not failure evidence.
 *  4. scale-to-zero: stop(stopped_by_system) idle runtimes past the idle
 *     window (Q4 ruling; revive-on-message undoes it)
 *  5. degraded-runtime policy: a re-adopted runtime has no event stream or
 *     stdin (pipes died with the previous daemon process); when mail arrives
 *     for one, stop it so revive-on-message hands the mailbox to a fresh
 *     generation — delivery stays bounded, I1 holds
 *  6. execute queued commands (claim → effect via driver → settle,
 *     generation-fenced, idempotent). Revive-on-message is bounded by the
 *     store's spawn-failure budget: a runtime that exits during boot counts
 *     against the BEE (not the wake command), the next wake sits on the B5
 *     backoff table, and at the budget `spawn_failed` is set and wakes stop —
 *     an explicit `revive` resets the budget and retries regardless
 *  7. delivery loop: push undelivered mailbox messages into live runtimes,
 *     honoring per-message urgency (v8, spec 01 Q2 amendment): `next` = the
 *     accept point (unchanged), `idle` = hold while the runtime is running,
 *     `now` = interrupt the turn first, then deliver. Urgency governs
 *     eligibility only; among eligible messages FIFO enqueue order wins
 *  8. I1 telemetry: record undelivered-past-deadline messages as structured
 *     violations (spec 04 behavior 5 — the 99.99% counter). An `idle`
 *     message's clock starts at eligibility (runtime left `running`), not at
 *     enqueue — long turns are not false violations
 *
 * Boot sequence (after every store reopen): reconcileAtBoot with the driver's
 * live pids, reap orphan processes the store no longer recognizes, and sweep
 * the mailbox for bees that need a send_wake. Crash anywhere is safe: the
 * mailbox and command queue are durable, and every effect is idempotent.
