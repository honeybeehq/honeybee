/**
 * The v2 RPC surface (spec 04 "RPC surface") — shared by the daemon's server
 * (rpc.ts) and the thin CLI client (v2/cli/src/client.ts).
 *
 * Transport: unix domain socket, jsonl frames (one json object per line).
 * Versioned hello, negotiated once: the server writes `{"protocol":"v2/1"}`
 * on connect; the client's FIRST frame must be `{"protocol":"v2/1"}`. A
 * mismatch is answered with a `protocol_mismatch` error and the connection is
 * closed. No capability sniffing.
 *
 * Requests:  {id, verb, params?}
 * Responses: {id, ok:true, result} | {id, ok:false, error:{code, message}}
 * Watch push frames (no id):
 *   {type:"delta", baseSeq, seq, events:[AuditRow…]}  — contiguous: baseSeq
 *     always equals the seq the client last held; anything else IS a gap.
 *   {type:"gap", seq} — the server bounded the batch (or restarted) and the
 *     client must refetch the snapshot (fail-closed cursor).
