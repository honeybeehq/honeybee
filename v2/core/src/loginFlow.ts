/**
 * Account login flows (spec 08 amendment, 2026-08-28 operator decision):
 * login is a first-class, tmux-independent Honeybee domain flow. The daemon
 * owns the flow row, the provider recipe's method descriptors, the worker
 * that runs it, credential validation/capture, and cleanup. Clients (Apiary,
 * the CLI) mirror the row and render it; they never scrape a terminal.
 *
 * SAFETY: a flow row is a MIRRORED, AUDITED record. It carries only safe
 * facts — never a raw CLI/PTY transcript, never a typed secret, never a
 * provider token. Authorization URLs and device user codes are shown to the
 * operator by design and are the only provider-issued strings that ride here.
