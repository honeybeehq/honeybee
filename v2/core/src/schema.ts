 */

/**
 * Stamped into meta('schema_version') on open. Bump when the schema changes
 * shape. Open refuses a NEWER store (downgrade — typed SchemaVersionError,
 * same failure mode as apiaryd's interface store, spec 06 §6); an OLDER (or
 * pre-stamp v1) store is migrated by explicit code in the store constructor —
 * never silently.
 *
 * History:
 *   v1 — WP1..WP6a shape (unstamped; stores without the meta key are v1).
 *   v2 — spec 06 §4.2 one-key idempotency: adds the nullable UNIQUE
 *        `commands.idempotency_key` column and the `rpc_idempotency` results
 *        table (additive; migration = ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN).
 *   v3 — WP7 continuity (spec 07 §F): adds `bees.provider_session_id` (the
 *        harness-native session/thread id revive resumes with),
 *        `bees.env` (per-bee env overrides, e.g. the harness config home an
 *        imported bee's session lives in) and `bees.imported_from`
 *        (provenance: null | "frozen"). Additive; migration = ALTER TABLE
 *        ADD COLUMN ×3.
 *   v4 — spawn-failure budget (contract §4.2 `spawn_failed`, spec 01 B5):
 *        adds `bees.spawn_failures`, the count of consecutive runtimes that
 *        exited during `booting`. One budget per bee across wake-driven
 *        revives; exhaustion sets `spawn_failed` and suppresses further
 *        wakes. Additive; migration = ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN.
 *   v5 — per-bee spawn args: adds `bees.args` (nullable json array of
 *        harness CLI args layered over the agent spec at spawn; the frozen
 *        importer fills it from the old record's launch argv so a resumed
 *        old-world bee keeps its model/effort/permission flags). Additive;
 *        migration = ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN ×1.
 *   v6 — pre-flip verb set (parenting, fork, questions, seals): adds
 *        `bees.parent_id` (nullable soft ref to the spawning bee),
 *        `bees.forked_from` (provenance: the bee this one was forked from)
 *        and `bees.fork_seed` (the source's provider session id the FIRST
 *        runtime forks from; consumed when the fork reports its own id),
 *        plus the `questions` and `seals` tables. Additive; migration =
 *        ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN ×3 + CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ×2.
 *   v7 — accounts and auth (spec 08 CORE): adds the `accounts` table (a
 *        provider login identity: harness + home + label + status + penalty),
 *        `account_limits` (the latest limits snapshot per account, feeding
 *        the calibrated selector), `selection_cursors` (durable selector
 *        cursors — rows, not a json file) and `bees.account`
 *        (declared intent, concrete after spawn — never 'auto'). Additive;
 *        migration = ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN ×1 + CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ×3.
 *   v8 — delivery urgency (spec 01 Q2 amendment 2026-08-18): adds
 *        `mailbox.urgency` ('now'|'next'|'idle', default 'next') — the meaning
 *        the reserved `priority` column was holding a seat for. `priority`
 *        stays for compat but is documentation-only; urgency is the semantics
 *        (eligibility, never FIFO reordering). Additive; migration =
 *        ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN ×1.
 *   v9 — synthetic-boot budget (the 2026-08-18 soak finding): adds
 *        `runtimes.boot_evidence` ('synthetic'|'real', NULL while booting) —
 *        HOW the runtime left `booting`. A readyAtSpawn harness (claude
 *        stream-json) gets a driver-minted synthetic `booted` at spawn; that
 *        must not reset the bee's spawn-failure budget, and a crashed/clean
 *        exit from a synthetic-running generation counts against the budget
 *        exactly like an exit during `booting`. Only REAL evidence (a signal
 *        the adapter parsed from actual process output) marks 'real' and
 *        resets the budget. Additive; migration = ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN ×1;
 *        existing live rows migrate as NULL, which counts as real for exit
 *        accounting (never punish a pre-migration runtime).
 *  v10 — pretty handles (operator ruling 2026-08-19): adds `bees.handle` —
 *        a short human display id (`CL.a3f2`: harness prefix + hex), minted
 *        by the owning node at spawn. UNIQUE per node (partial index; the
 *        daemon is the sole writer, so minting is a local check + retry —
 *        no distributed coordination). The UUID stays the one canonical id
 *        in tables/RPC; handles are the human tier of the resolution ladder
 *        (exact id → exact handle → exact name → unique prefix). Additive;
 *        migration = ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN ×1 + backfill mint for existing
 *        rows (an imported bee whose old id already looks like a handle
 *        keeps it as its handle).
 *  v11 — agent task lists (brought back from v1 `hive task`): `tasks` (one
 *        row per micro-task; bee lists cascade with the bee; shared lists
 *        have bee_id NULL) and `task_supply` (per-bee auto-supply config +
 *        breaker). Delivery stays the mailbox — feeding a task is one idle
 *        send. Additive; migration = CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ×2.
 *  v12 — typed account-limit failures: adds
 *        `account_limits.unreadable_reason`, a closed classification that
 *        lets clients distinguish unsupported providers, expired/failed
 *        authentication, provider errors, and timeouts without parsing prose.
 *        Additive; migration = ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN ×1.
 *  v13 — provider-authored display windows: adds
 *        `account_limits.display_windows` as a JSON array. Standard 5h/weekly
 *        fields remain the routing contract; display windows preserve named
 *        multi-pool plans such as Cursor Models vs Other Models.
 *        Additive; migration = ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN ×1.
 *  v14 — durable automatic-naming usage: adds the append-only `naming_usage`
 *        telemetry table. It records one row per generator attempt, including
 *        direct-API token counts, the price rates used at request time,
 *        estimated cost, latency, and provider request ids. It is operational
 *        telemetry (like rpc_idempotency), not replayable Hive state.
 *  v15 — crash-safe runner observation recovery: adds
 *        `runtime_observation_cursors`, one generation-fenced applied byte
 *        cursor into the runner host's output-only observation journal. The
 *        daemon advances it only after every normalized effect through that
 *        cursor has committed; restart replay is therefore deterministic and
 *        at-least-once without crossing runtime generations.
 *  v16 — account login flows (tmux-independent login, 2026-08-28): adds
 *        `login_flows`, the durable, mirrored record of one account's
 *        sign-in (methods, phase, authorization URL / device code, requested
 *        input descriptors, typed error, revision). Carries no secret and no
 *        raw worker output. Additive; migration = CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS.
 *  v17 — provider-declared flag expiry: adds `flags.resets_at` and backfills
 *        parseable reset instants from existing resource-blocked details.
 *  v18 — bounded mailbox history: adds `mail_history_enqueues`, its projection
 *        cursor, and partial audit indexes for bounded lifecycle/deletion
 *        folding. Additive; migration creates and backfills the projection.
 *  v19 — `refresh_deferred` limits class: widens the
 *        `account_limits.unreadable_reason` CHECK so a refresh stood down to
 *        a live runtime (which owns the rotating OAuth chain, HIVE-2) is
 *        typed distinctly from a real auth failure. SQLite cannot alter a
 *        CHECK, so the migration rebuilds the table and carries rows across.
 *  v20 — earned Codex reset credits: adds the nullable
 *        `account_limits.rate_limit_reset_credits` JSON snapshot.
 *  v21 — bounded external-parent lineage: adds `bees.parent_external`, a
 *        required boolean flag that distinguishes a globally unique parent
 *        owned outside this node from the existing local soft reference.
 *        Existing rows default to local lineage (`0`).
